class : Enemy
	variables:
			int x;
			int y;
    methods: int getX();
             int getY();
             int getClass(); //advanced
             void updatePosition();
             constructor(x,y): initialize position(x,y);
             				   set speed;
           


Arraylist of enemies(birds); 
Arraylist of bullets(velocity, position)
class : Bullet
    methods: int getVelocityX();
             int getVelocityY();
             int getX();
             int getY();
Class : Player
    methods: int GetHealth();
             int getX();
             int getY();
  
Arraylist of obstacles : this could be either randomly generated or prebuilt(sorta like a dungeon)


Advanced: Different types of enemies
          Different weapons
          User interface
        
Game :
       method: start();
       //we basically have a button when the program runs, when the user clicks this button, you, the graphics programmer,
       should run this method. We will implement the actual thing.
       
       start() :
               spawn birds
               initialize player location
               initialize terrain
               start main game loop:
                    birds get closer to player(advacned: respond to collision), if they hit player health decreases, player moves around and 
                    shoots bullets(mouse and keyboard events...) create and destroy bullets in arraylist. update player position
                    update bird position.
                    (this is not even pseudocode yet but we will figure things out, (i hope))
