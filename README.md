  please don't view, use, or indeed think about using this program.
  would you play, or even look at, a game made by a lousy team who, if you believe me, don't even bother to write comments as they code? of course not! much better to play a game by people who actually know what they are doing.
  On a very minor side note, the unresponsive lousy people's game actually works. This is surely nothing but a giant stroke of luck, a minor miracle, or an evil trick. The professional, talented team's program needs some work to actually resemble something like a game. But I'm sure they will get there.
